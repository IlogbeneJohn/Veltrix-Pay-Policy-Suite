3.1 Account Management

•	Dormant accounts must be disabled after 30 days of inactivity.  
•	Accounts must be reviewed quarterly to confirm validity.  
•	Accounts with access to the core payment ledger require additional approval from the Head of Engineering.  
3.2 Least Privilege

o	Changed every 90 days (or compliant with NIST 800-63B if modernized)  
•	Access to the merchant settlement dashboard requires hardware-token MFA.  
3.6 Remote Access
